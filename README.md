# Serious Sam Classic dedicated server configs for TFE and TSE
- init.ini with scripts and configurations
Personal game settings and commands for server management (map change, etc.)
- Engine.dll as a patch for blank server-side chat messages
A patch for making server print in-game messages with just a colon instead of "Server:" (better for complex output).
